    The usap.gov website
    A website (also written as a web site) is any web page whose content is identified by a common domain name and is
    published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news,
    education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site,
    which often starts with a home page. The most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook.[1][2]
    
    All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can
    only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites
    on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a
    web browser.</p>
